# Sorting Algorithms Repository

Welcome to the **Sorting Algorithms Repository**, a personal collection of Python and Java implementations for various sorting algortihms. This repo serves
as a storage for my own code, primarily originating from university courses and LeetCode problem-solving challenges. The repository is open to anyone who wants
to explore and learn different sorting techniques.

## Contents
The repository includes implementations of popular sorting algorithms, such as:
- Bubble Sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Heap sort
- And more...

Each file is self-contained, with clear function definitions and comments explaining the logic behind the algorithm.

## Usage
Feel free to clone or download the repo to explore the code, run the scripts, and modify them for your learning purposes.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/thomasdmcmahon/sorting.git
```

## Contributions
While the repo mainly serves as personal storage, contributions and suggestions for improving the code or adding new algortihms are always welcome!
